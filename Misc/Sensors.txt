Exhaust cam sensors have 3 wires
+12v
Ground
Signal - normally high, pulled low when triggered.

Signal output goes through a 100 ohm resistor, then is clamped to 3.3v with a zener diode to ground, then goes through a 200 ohm resistor and into the Arduino input pin.

If the cam sensors have 2 wires, you'll have to purchase or make your own VR Conditioner board (check the Speeduino project for more information) to convert the signal into something the Arduino can handle. 

Crank sensor is a TCRT5000 on carrier board with an LM393, available from many different vendors. Either get a 3.3v board, or if you get a 5v version of the board, clamp the voltage down to 3.3v with a zener diode to ground.
